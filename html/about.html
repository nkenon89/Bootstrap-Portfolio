                <p>Hello!</br>My name is Nick, I am a 29 year old former health and fitness coach turned I.T professional and web developer. After several years of waning interest in my field I decided in May of 2018 that I was going tochallenge myself to make a change!</p> 
                    
                <p>I had very much enjoyed my nearly ten year long career in health and fitness- but Ineeded something more!</p>
                        
                <p>I craved something more intellectually stimulating. Something where I could be creativeand challenged by my work. Something that could offer me a more sustainable career path and financialstability.</p>
                        
                <p>After a couple months of research and some web development self study I decided to invest in myselfand my new career and attend the UNC Coding Bootcamp. It was a 6 month program focused on full stack javascriptdeveloping. Throughout the course of the program we were exposed to everything from basic html markup to advancedjavascript libraries such as React.</p>
                        
                <p>Over the course of the past year I have learned an incredible amount about afield I initially knew nothing about! This process has been exhilarating and left me wanting even more. Web developmenthas been a steep learning curve and I imagine it will continue to be, but this type of challenge is exactly what I waslooking for!</p>
                        
                <p>I am still green, but I am passionate and excited to learn more. I am teachable and absorb newinformation quickly. What I am looking for is a company that will take me under their wing and give me a chance to learnand break into the industry. I am confident that at this stage I have been exposed to enough that even if I donâ€™t know alanguage or technology, I will be able to learn it with relative ease.</p>
